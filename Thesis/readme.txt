This thesis is about the monitoring technique of Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) at SRAM memories and is based on (is an extension of) "Self-Healing Integrated Circuits/Systems in Semiconductor Nanometer Technologies" thesis of Eleni-Maria Dounavi. There are a .pdf file that concers the report of the thesis and the files of a designed SRAM circuit using the Virtuoso tool in collaboration with SPECTRE simulation of Cadence. The basic SRAM circuit was designed by Eleni-Maria Dounavi while there were added more schematics in order to implement my thesis. One of them is the Vivi schematic that is the top level schematic that was used.
